<h1 class="title">Status update</h1>
<p>
Information below could be personal.
</p>

<p>
Here records the update history of my personal status, mainly in ability/knowledge content. Serveral important machine/projects' construction could also be recorded.
</p>

<p>
The aim of this recording is to give one view of one person's change on status(like in rpg) over time. I wouldn't say that it's necessarily good or promoting for society or blah blah, but rather an interesting thing to do, plus I personally would want one of these from a person sharing my goal here and now to have some clue what should I be doing to approach my goal.
</p>

<p>
The status would be hosted on github. A regular update is imagined to be once a month, but would change under special occasions.
