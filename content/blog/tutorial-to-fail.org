* Tutorial to fail
This tutorial is a continuous process journaling on failures I encountered personally, my reflections on them, and my strategies to/not to get over them. Some of them might even don't have existing proved way to get over.

You can use this tutorial as a checklist, to see if you have the same cause of failure I do/did.

You can also experiment my strategies to see if they work for you.

If you do, or have similar strategies, or have similar problems which you treat with different strategies, I'd be more than pleased to recieve mails about them.
